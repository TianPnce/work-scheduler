# Work Scheduler

## Site Description
This challenge was to create a small calendar that would allow the user to schedule events for every hour of the day and to be able to save those events. Aswell as letting the user know the time, and the time that the events are taking place. For example, gray is in the past, red means the present, and green is upcoming events in the future.
